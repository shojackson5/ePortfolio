### Enhancement Two Narrative

The artifacts I have selected to use for enhancement two remove the hard coded access to the database and implement user authentication for accessing the database through the web app. The project objective was to create a client-facing web application linked to an animal shelter database to aid the company in identifying dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. I chose to improve the app by first creating a user authentication controller for a user to create an account and login. I also created a user model that hashes usersâ€™ passwords before storing and also verifies the user by comparing the password provided with the one stored.

By making these enhancements I have demonstrated my ability to implement security measures to not only mitigate vulnerabilities but protect the database and user data as well by encrypting their password for storage.

I met the course outcomes I aimed to achieve with this assignment. By transferring the app to Java to be used in MEAN full stack development, I removed the hard coded database access and added user authentication in order to access the site. These enhancements allowed me to achieve course outcome five, which is to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
