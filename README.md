## Enhancement One Narrative

The artifact I have selected to use for enhancement one is the CRUD Python code from a project I completed in the CS340 course. The project objective was to create a client-facing web application linked to an animal shelter database to aid the company in identifying dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. I chose this artifact because I believe it could benefit from being updated to an app with full stack development using MEAN.

By transferring the program to JavaScript to be used in a full stack development, it demonstrated my ability to design a program in a different programming language. By enhancing this artifact, it is more in line with current standards and practices for web applications. This was the first step in recreating the app using MEAN full stack development.

I met the course outcomes I aimed to achieve with this assignment. In order to enhance this artifact, I had to start building the rest of the project in order put in the links to other parts of the project that the CRUD part must interact with. I had to also create the model that the controller talks to in order to get the schema for performing the CRUD functions on the data retrieved. I also had to work ahead a little in order to learn and include the error codes and messages displayed for input validation against the schema.
