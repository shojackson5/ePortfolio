### CS499 Computer Science Capstone

#### **Professional Self-Assessment**

This self-assessment encapsulates my journey through the Computer Science program and highlights how my coursework has prepared me for a career in the field. I have built a strong foundation in software development, data management, and security, all while refining my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. My goal is to leverage these skills in a professional setting where I can contribute to innovative and impactful projects.

As my time in the Computer Science program comes to an end, I reflect on the knowledge and hands-on experience I have gained over the past two years. Throughout this program, I have enhanced my technical skills, expanded my understanding of software development, and strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively in a professional environment. My coursework, along with the development of this ePortfolio, highlights my skills in important areas of computer science, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases.

This ePortfolio has allowed me to present my technical growth and my ability to apply what I have learned to real-world applications. The project I chose to enhance for this portfolio is an application developed for an animal shelter as part of my CS340 coursework. This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop full-stack web applications that interact with a database. I have strengthened my proficiency in the following areas:

#### **Programming and Software Development**
My coursework has allowed me to gain experience in multiple programming languages, including Java and Python. My enhancements, such as transferring a Python-based application to Java and integrating it with the MEAN stack, demonstrate my ability to work between languages.
#### **Data Structures and Algorithms** 
Understanding how to efficiently store and process data is invaluable in the field of computer science. By implementing security enhancements, refining database access control, and optimizing data retrieval, I have applied data structure and algorithm principles to create an efficient and scalable solution.
#### **Database Management** 
My ability to design, optimize, and secure databases is evident in my work with SQL and NoSQL databases. Creating a MongoDB interface using the MEAN stack showcases my knowledge of modern database technologies and the importance of data accessibility in web applications.
#### **Security and Secure Development Practices** 
Data and application security are a crucial aspect of software development. I implemented security enhancements in my project requiring authentication for database access and encrypting user data. These improvements reflect my ability to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and mitigate risks through secure coding practices.
#### **Collaboration and Communication** 
Successfully working on projects requires clear communication with stakeholders and collaboration with team members. My ability to present technical concepts to non-technical audiences, particularly in data visualization and system design, highlights my strength in bridging the gap between technology and business needs. Throughout my coursework, I have worked on group projects that required effective communication and task delegation which has prepared me for professional settings where teamwork and clear documentation are critical to project success.
### Overview
The project I chose to enhance for this ePortfolio is an application developed for an animal shelter as part of my CS340 coursework during the August 2024 semester. The application was a web interface to an animal shelter database. The project objective was to implement a way for an Animal Rescue company to view the database and find eligible dogs what would be good candidates for different types of search and rescue operations.
