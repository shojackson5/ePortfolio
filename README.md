**Original Project Code**

The project I chose to enhance for this ePortfolio is an application developed for an animal shelter as part of my CS340 coursework during the August 2024 semester. The application was a web interface to an animal shelter database. The project objective was to implement a way for an Animal Rescue company to view the database and find eligible dogs what would be good candidates for different types of search and rescue operations
